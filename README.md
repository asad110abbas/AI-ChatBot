Hybrid Chatbot
Overview
The Hybrid Chatbot is an intelligent conversational agent that seamlessly integrates AI-based natural language processing (NLP) with rule-based logic to provide dynamic, context-aware, and structured interactions. This dual approach ensures that the chatbot delivers accurate responses by leveraging predefined rules for simple queries while using machine learning models to handle complex, nuanced conversations.

Designed for flexibility, scalability, and ease of customization, this chatbot can be deployed across multiple platforms, including websites, customer support systems, and messaging applications. The hybrid approach ensures that the chatbot remains efficient and reliable while continuously improving through AI-based learning.

Installation
Prerequisites
Before installing, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.7+
pip (Python package manager)
Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

Usage
The chatbot can operate in three different modes:

Rule-Based Mode: Uses predefined rules and workflows to answer specific questions.
AI Mode: Utilizes machine learning models for NLP-based responses.
Hybrid Mode (Recommended): Dynamically switches between rule-based and AI-driven responses based on query complexity.
To configure the chatbot‚Äôs behavior, update the settings in config.json. You can also integrate external APIs to fetch live data for dynamic responses.

Customization & Training
To improve the chatbot‚Äôs AI capabilities:

Train an NLP model with custom datasets using TensorFlow, spaCy, or Rasa.
Fine-tune predefined responses for accuracy in rule-based mode.
Use logs and user interactions to enhance the AI model for better performance.
